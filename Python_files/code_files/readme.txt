This should be the main working directory when working with the ML tool developed.
******************************************************************************************


******************************************************************************************
This directory contains the several other directories from where the dataset is 
being picked up, trained models are being saved, and various other modes in which 
this tool is tested.
******************************************************************************************


******************************************************************************************
For running or opening the tool here, one should have Python Environment already setup.
This tool was developed and tested in Spyder Environment provided by Anaconda3 Software.
******************************************************************************************


******************************************************************************************
To run the tool one should follow below steps:
1. Open "Anaconda Prompt".
2. The location of files named "tool1.py", "ML_Tool_UI.py" and other python files should 
   be made as primary working directory. This can be done by "cd" command.
3. After this directory as made as main working directory, then just run the "run_me.cmd"
   file, by typing its name and pressing Enter.
4. After few checks of libraries required, all the libraries that are required would get
   installed and the created Python Tool would appear.

The utility provided by this tool is that we can design a 2-stage Single Ended Operational
Amplifier with desired specifications. The tool would give outputs as circuit parameters, 
which are to be fed to Cadence Virtuoso Software for verification. The steps for that are 
given in "Cadence_files/readme.txt".
